## Overview

The 1v1 MCQ Battle Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to allow users to engage in real-time quiz competitions. The application features a secure authentication system and a complete content management system for creating and managing the multiple-choice questions that power the battles. The backend is a robust API built with Django, while the frontend is a dynamic and responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out with a persistent session managed by JWT and cookies.
- **Full MCQ Management (CRUD):** Authenticated users have full control to create, read, update, and delete multiple-choice questions.
- **Protected Routes:** The MCQ management dashboard is secured and only accessible to logged-in users.
- **Dynamic UI:** The interface, built with Ant Design and styled with Tailwind CSS, is clean, responsive, and updates dynamically based on user authentication status.
- **API Integration:** A centralized Axios instance with interceptors automatically handles authentication tokens for secure communication with the backend.
- **User-Friendly Notifications:** Real-time feedback for actions like login success or errors is provided using React Toastify.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.8+) and Pip
- Node.js (v20.19+) and npm

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/SomilJain28/1V1-MCQ-BATTLE.git]
    cd 1V1-MCQ-BATTLE
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    _(Note: Create a `requirements.txt` file first by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your activated venv after installing all packages.)_

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create an admin user:**

    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7.  **Start the Django server:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    _(Open a new terminal window for this)_

    ```sh
    cd ../mcq-battle
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `mcq-battle` root directory and add the backend API URL:

    ```
    VITE_BASE_API_URL=[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
    ```

4.  **Start the Vite development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
